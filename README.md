# Diabetes-Prediction
Classify whether someone has diabetes or not.


Aim:-
The objective of this project is to classify whether someone has diabetes or not.

Information:-
Dataset consists of several Medical Variables(Independent) and one Outcome Variable(Dependent)
We  used different classification algorithm .Based on GridSearchCv method use for hyperparameter. 
Used different performance matrix for performance measures,But we consider F1 score for conclusion because of F1-score is a better metric when there are imbalanced classes as in the our case.

Conclusion:-
I have achieved a very weak accuracy with 75% by our k-NN model.
So we conclude from different algorithm  that Random Forest is best algorithm with 81% accuracy for this problem with given dataset.
Although accuracy is 81% but it is not good in medical field because one wrong prediction measure effects on patient.
